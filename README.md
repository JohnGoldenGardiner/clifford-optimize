# clifford-optimize
File [clifford_optimization.py](clifford_optimization.py) contains classes and functions useful for efficiently simulating Clifford circuits and finding expectation values of stabilizer states. Also includes functions that are potentially useful for finding good initial parameters for variational quantum algorithms or for "near-Clifford" error mitigation techniques.

Work in progress. Things added as I find them useful.
